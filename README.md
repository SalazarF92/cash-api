Description 

This API consists in a financial management tool that allows users to transfer money to other users. The API has been developed with a focus on security and reliability, incorporating features such as rollback in case something goes wrong during a transaction.

The architecture of the API is decoupled, making use of abstract classes to separate the different components and make the code more modular and maintainable. This allows for easy updates and expansion of the API in the future.

The API also includes CRUD functionality for both users and transactions, allowing for complete management of financial data. Additionally, tests have been implemented using Jest to ensure that the rules governing user and transactions are working correctly.

Running the project is as simple as running the command 'docker-compose up', which will start the API on the default port of 3000. This makes it easy to get up and running with the API, without the need for complex setup or configuration."

Obs:. Must have the DSN_RABBIT key to work properly with queues.
